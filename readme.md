# GUI Builder

Gui Builder is a free visual editor for Vaadin Flow.

## How to develop

Instructions nicked from rollup docs:

`npm run build` builds the application to `public/bundle.js`, along with a sourcemap file for debugging.

`npm start` launches a server, using [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve). Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`npm run watch` will continually rebuild the application as your source files change.

`npm run dev` will run `npm start` and `npm run watch` in parallel.
