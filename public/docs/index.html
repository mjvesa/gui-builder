    <h1>GUI Builder</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      GUI Builder is an application for editing user interfaces visually. It
      provides direct editing of components by dragging and dropping them on a
      canvas and an outline representation of the element tree. Elements can be
      selected and the properties of the selected elements can be modified as
      strings in a table. For many elements and properties special custom
      editors are provided with an editing experience suited for each component
      or property set in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the GUI Builder architecture has provisions for swapping out the
      target framework and component set, currently only Vaadin is supported.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>UI overview</h2>
    <p>The UI consists of the following parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A header with button to rescan the components, selector for edited
        component and a save button
      </li>
      <li>Outline is a tree representation of the component</li>
      <li>Canvas where the components are rendered</li>
      <li>
        Inspector contains a table of properties and a space for custom editors
        for the currently seleted component
      </li>
      <li>
        Palette provides list of elements that can be dragged on the edited
        component
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/full_view.png" />

    <h3>Outline</h3>
    <p>
      The outline provides a tree form view to the component. Sometimes it can
      be easier and more precise to drag and drop elements in the outline vs.
      using the canvas. Elements can be selected by clicking on them. When an
      element is selected, a border is drawn around it and its children to
      indicate that they have been selected. The inspector tab is also opened to
      display the properties of the selected element.
    </p>
    <img src="images/outline_buttons.png" />

    <h3>Inspector</h3>
    <p>
      The inpector is for modifying the properties of the selected component
      (these are attributes in the case of Vaadin). There are two ways to edit
      them: you can use a table of key value pairs, or custom editors that
      target specific elements and property sets. For example, Vaadin Button has
      its own editor and flexbox properties have their own editor that can be
      used with any element. An empty key and value in the table is considered
      to be non-existent, so to delete an attribute, clear out the row.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h3>Palette</h3>
    <p>
      The palette is list of elements that can be dragged and dropped to the
      outline or to the canvas. Components found in the project via scanning are
      also present in the palette. There are two ways to add these to the
      component: by dragging the name of the element to insert it as an element,
      or by dragging the "expand" next to the element tag to expand the contents
      of the component into the current one.
    </p>

    <h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
    <p>
      The supported keyboard shortcuts include the usual copy, cut, paste,
      delete and undo/redo:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ctrl+C copies the selected element</li>
      <li>Ctrl+X cuts the selected element</li>
      <li>Ctrl+V pastes what has been copied or cut last</li>
      <li>Ctrl+Del deletes the selected element</li>
      <li>Ctrl+Z undoes the latest change</li>
      <li>
        Ctrl+Y redoes the latest undone change, can be repeated until there are
        no undone changes
      </li>
    </ul>
    The keyboard shortcuts currently work only when the mouse is not on the
    canvas, as the iframe swallows any keyboard events. This limitation will be
    removed shortly.
    <h2>Template formats</h2>
    GUI Builder supports two different template formats for Vaadin: Lit
    templates are the same that can be edited using Vaadin Designer and plain
    Java templates consist of plain Java code that uses the Element API to
    contruct the element tree.
    <h3>Lit templates</h3>
    <p>
      Lit templates are Web Components written in a subset of Lit element
      features. Namely expressions and nested templates are not supported. Many
      templates from <a href="https://start.vaadin.com">start.vaadin.com</a> can
      be edited, but some can't simply because the necessary data is only
      available during runtime.
    </p>

    <h3>Java templates</h3>
    <p>
      Templates can be written in a subset of Java. The subset is equal to
      expressive power to Lit templates, which means it can be used to build a
      tree of components and set attributes on those components. Due to the
      restrictive nature of the subset, it is very unlikely you would want to
      edit existing components using it, but new ones can be created with
      greater ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of using the Component API, Java support uses the Element API
      which allows creating arbitrary components instead of relying on what is
      exposed in the Component API. This removes many inconsistencies that exist
      between the Component API and the API that is available to those who use
      vaadin components directly on the client side.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the Java support, special markers need to be inserted somewhere
      into the Java component file that is to be edited with the GUI Builder:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>// GUI CONSTRUCTION BEGIN</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>// GUI CONSTRUCTION END</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also the variable <code>root</code> should be available. That variable is
      used as the root of the component tree, and new elements are placed into
      it at the topmost level. Here is an example of the construction of simple
      component in class <code>SimpleView</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
  public SimpleView() {
    Element root = this.getElement();
    Element someButton;
    // GUI CONSTRUCTION BEGIN
    Element verticalLayout = new Element("vaadin-vertical-layout");
    root.appendChild(verticalLayout);
    Element button = new Element("vaadin-button");
    verticalLayout.appendChild(button);
    button.setText("Click me");
    button.setAttribute("theme","primary");
    someButton = button;
    // GUI CONSTRUCTION END
  }
  </code></pre>
    <p>
      To use an element outside the generated code, use the "Common properties"
      editor and the "Variable name" field to give the element a variable name
      where it is set in the generated code. It is up to you to provide a
      variable by that name in the scope you choose.
